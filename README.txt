This game stores score in terms of highest level and quickest time.

To restart the game a user must click the escape key.
	When restarting there are multiple negative effects:
	1. When a restart is done 20 seconds is added to the total time. 
	2. One life is also deducted from the total of 10 lives. 

There are fake goals that increase in frequency as the level number increases. 
These fake goals trigger trap walls that block off the winning hole from the player and force the player to have to restart. However, sometimes it isn't always apparent that the goal is blocked off in an effort to waste time if the player isn't vigilant. 

Once a player completes 5 levels, or loses, they are taken to an end screen which shows highest scores and levels and displays the players current scores for that round.
